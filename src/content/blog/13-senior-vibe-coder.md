  AI isn't making software developers obsolete. It's making senior developers more important

In the previous article I mentioned that I used AI to [refresh this site](../blog/12-refresh), in everything from migrating the data from the previous site to choosing a new platform to use. That's far from the first time I have used AI, in fact I use it more often for work more than anything. I have been using everything from single code functions to full build and deployment scripts are now faster than ever before. Even the image in the banner for this entry was generated with [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com).

Indeed the past year has been a somewhat annoying, somewhat entertaining year where people swung from predicting that "AI is going to replace developers" to the rise of a new job position: the [vibe code cleanup specialist](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/arkadiy-kazazyan-652b20b_meet-the-new-job-title-of-2025vibe-code-activity-7363569300021862402-MEWF/)

## Understanding the "Vibe code cleanup specialist"

Tapan Patel provides an insightful definition of what a "vibe code cleanup specialist" is:

> A vibe coding cleanup specialist is a senior software engineer who specializes in fixing AI-generated code and transforming vibe-coded prototypes into secure, scalable, production-ready applications.

Indeed, you could see that there had been a lot of people who have immediately embraced this title based on their LinkedIn profiles:

And while for some this might be tongue-in-cheek or, perhaps, just plain desperate considering the volatile software development market, the software development community is at odds with what to make of it:

> The emergence of vibe coding cleanup specialists has stirred debate in the tech community. Some developers dismiss it as "AI babysitting," arguing that senior engineers shouldn't spend time cleaning up messes that AI creates. 
>
> Others embrace the role, noting it allows them to focus on high-level architecture and system design rather than writing boilerplate code from scratch. The reality is that vibe coding excels at speed but fails at the details that matter for production systems.
