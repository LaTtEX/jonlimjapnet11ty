    <p>One of the major concerns I had when I shifted away from my software developer role was the uncertainty over the future. </p><p>Just like any developer I had aspired for a career that steadily progressed from junior to a senior developer, and beyond that I imagined becoming some sort of software engineering manager, head of software engineering, or even a CTO role. But the role shift that had happened threw me off of that track, and it was jarring, unsettling, and uncomfortable trying to, all of a sudden, reimagine a future far different from what I've envisioned in the past.</p><p>The stakes were also higher as I have a daughter entering university soon, and the financial implications of her schooling added one more thing for me to worry about.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1510596713412-56030de252c8?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fHVuY2VydGFpbnR5fGVufDB8fHx8MTcxODM1OTg2Mnww&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="Long and winding road towards fog"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@katiemoum?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit">Katie Moum</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>I spoke to my mother about my concerns, and as moms do, she gave me a sobering splash of reality. </p><p>First, she asked me if my role change involved a pay cut. I responded no. She pointed out that the level of income that I enjoy was nowhere near what she earned during her career â€“ and everything turned out fine. </p><p>Second, she reminded me of the time when she, a college professor, faced a similar shift when she transferred from one academic department to another. She recalled that, while she initially felt rejected by her first department, most of her greatest career achievements occurred <em>after</em> she had made that shift.</p><p>Ryan Holiday, in The Daily Stoic, writes</p><blockquote>... it might not seek like it makes a big difference to see life as something you <em><strong>have</strong></em> to do versus <strong>get</strong> to do, but there it is. A huge, magnificent difference.</blockquote><p>I am thankful for the people in my life who nudge me and remind me that, while there are challenges ahead, ultimately, I'm <em>lucky</em> to be able to even send my kids to school and university. I'm <em>lucky</em> I still even have a job. </p><p>And I'm<em> </em>privileged that<em> </em>I get to do, the things that I have to do.</p>
